This package implements a ROS node linked with hpp-manipulation-corba

The goal is to specify manipulation planning tasks implying one robot and one
or several objects and to execute the task on the robot.

Following is a list of what remains to do:
  - provide initial and goal position of objects via subscriber,
  - merge position of object and configuration of robot into a configuration of
    composite robot,
  - transform goal trajectory of composite robot into trajectories of the robot
  - handle gripper along manipulation paths.

In a longer term,
  - replace python initialization by ros elements (topics, services, parameters)
